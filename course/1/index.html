        			We looked at a lot of other courses that teach people to code or build websites, and we deicided to do things a bit differently.

1. Actual skills that are used in Industry.
That means we won't be using beginner tools like Scratch, Alice, or AppInventor.

Why?
- Better idea of what it's like in industry
- skills you might use again after the course
Tradeoff:
- slower, more challenging learning curve

--- secondly ---

A lot of courses have you building your own project by yourself. We're going to get everyone to work on the same project together.

A lot of the interesting parts of working on software are how we work together, communicate ideas, even just how two people can work on the same code at the same time without rewriting each other's changes. You don't experience any of that if you only work by yourself.

The tradeoff
- you need to learn MORE tools
- it's more challenging

--- so, challenging ---

So, we made a lot of choices that make this course more challenging. And some of it may be tricky. But we're all in this together, we're here to help and you're here to help each other.

There's no magic or bad luck in programming. If something goes wrong, there's always a reason why and there's always a way to fix it.

Sometimes it can be frustrating, there are lots of mental tricks that coders use to help get in a good state of mind the figure out problems, and we'll teach you some of those during the course.

					<h2>What is a web app?</h2>
					<p class="fragment">A web page</p>
					<p class="fragment">that does stuff</p>
					<p class="fragment">(post updates, buy products, chat, search…)</p>
				<aside class="notes">
Web apps are any websites that actually do stuff. For example, TradeMe, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, Pinterest are all web applications (apps). If a website lets you post updates, buy products, or chat with people, it's a web app.

Basically, a web app is both the web page that you see in your browser, and a computer program behind the scenes.
