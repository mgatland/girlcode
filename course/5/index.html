					<h2>Welcome to Scrum</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Planning Meeting</p>
					<p class="fragment">The Sprint</p>
					<p class="fragment">Standups</p>
					<p class="fragment">Code Reviews</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						in a full-time software project, each sprint would be two weeks. Most people work 5 days a week, and do about 6 hours of project work (after the meetings and admin tasks) in their working day. This means we would have 5 days x 2 weeks x 10 people x 6 hours = 600 hours in our two week sprint.

						At the start of a new sprint, we would have a Planning Meeting where we take tasks off the backlog - which just a big to-do list. And go over each task, talk it through, prioritise it (important, not important) and estimate how long we think it will take.

						The planning meeting goes on until you have enough tasks to fill up the whole sprint - 600 hours in this case.

						Then the sprint starts. People take tasks from the board, assign them to themselves, and work on them.

						Every day is the standup meeting, where we tell each other how we're going and if we need help. This helps us focus on a job if it's taking longer than expected, or bring in new tasks if everything is going ahead of schedule although that rarely happens!

						At the end of the sprint, we do a 'sprint retrospective' aka a demo. we invite anyone who cares about our product to come to a meeting and see the changes we have made. Afterwards, we discuss how the sprint went and how we can make the next one better.

						At Girl Code, because the course is very short, we simplify the process:
						* Alice + Matt do most of the planning before you arrive.
						* We go over the tickets at the start of each 2 hour "sprint"
						* we have standup as normal
						* at the end we do a brief demo of the new features

					<h2>Pair Programming</h2>
					<p class="fragment">It's a thing</p>
					<p class="fragment">One driver, one navigator</p>
					<p class="fragment">(We'll swap half way through.)</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>From now on, we'll be working in pairs. That means two people, one computer.</p>
						<p>Pair programming is a real thing - we didn't make it up, it's used in industry. (Most people do it occasionally, some really extreme companies do it all the time.)</p>
						<p>One person is the driver, they actually use the computer. The other is the navigator - their job is to watch what the driver is doing, point out mistakes (without being annoying!) and discuss ideas with them.</p>
						<p>As a navigator, you should NOT be coding but feel free to have your laptop open on the instructions or google questions as they come up.</p>
						<p>As a driver, you need to explain what you're doing and bounce ideas off your navigator.</p>
