		<p>Ten students meet once a week in Auckland to create a new website together.</p>

		<p>Girl Code is for beginners with no previous experience. At the end of the course, you'll have a finished project to show your friends and family.</p>

		<h2>Wait, what am I signing up for?</h2>

		<p>You're going to build a "web application" (website!) with 2 experienced mentors and 9 other girls.</p>

		<p>You don't need any previous experience. We will teach you what you need to know.</p>

		<p>We meet on Thursday nights, from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM. You should attend all 8 classes.</p>

		<p>As well as coming to class, you'll need to reserve <strong>3 hours each week</strong> to work on the project at home.</p>

		<h2>Who are you?</h2>
