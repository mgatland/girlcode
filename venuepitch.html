		<p>We're looking for a cheap or free venue for a new kind of weekly coding club. Please let us know if you can help out!</p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-xs-7">

				<h2>What's this about?</h2>

				<p>Girl Code is a self-funded weekly coding club built around collaborative projects, for girls aged 15 to 19.</p>

				<p><strong>Girls aged 15 to 19</strong> – Girls in this age range are deciding on their future careers, but they don't normally attend the other learn-to-code activities we've been involved in.</p>

				<p><strong>Collaborative Projects</strong> – Learn by working together on real projects, rather than solo exercises that are thrown away when finished.</p>

				<p><strong>Weekly Club</strong> – It's easier to stick to your hobby when you're part of a community. We're creating a club that people join and belong to, not a holiday program or one-time workshop.</p>

				<p><strong>Self-Funded</strong> – Our students pay and our mentors are paid. This ensures that students, parents and mentors are all committed and take the club seriously. While free events are an essential part of the ecosystem, not every event can be free. We need money to run a long-term club and develop new material each week.</p>

				<h2>Looking for a Venue</h2>

				<p>We need a meeting room for 12 people, from <strong>6:00 PM to 9:00 PM</strong> on <strong>Thursday nights</strong> for at least <strong>8 weeks</strong>.</p>

				<p>We need <strong>wifi, a projector and powerpoints</strong>.</p>

				<p>We can pay but not very much.</p>

				<p>Please email mgatland@gmail.com if you can make this happen for us :)</p>

					<div class="panel-heading"><h2>Girl Code 101</h2></div>
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>We're starting with an 8-week course for 10 students.</p>
						<p>The students will learn basic dev skills, then build a web application together.</p>
						<p>At the end of the course, some girls will hopefully want to carry on – they'll become the first members of the Girl Code community.</p>

						<p>From here, we'll continue to run an 8-week training program each term. Students who graduate join the main community, where they work on larger projects and take on more leadership roles.</p>
